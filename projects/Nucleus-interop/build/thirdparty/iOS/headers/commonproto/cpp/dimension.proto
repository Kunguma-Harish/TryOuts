		Scale - Growing proportionally with respect to child or parent. 
		Fixed - Either child or parent remain fixed i.e. A child can grown beyond the boundary of the parent. 
		Auto - Child  occupying the available space / Parent encompassing all the children.

		Case 1 - Parent is set to Scale . Child set to : 
		1.1 - Scale : Child resized - parent follows. Parent resized - child follows. 
		1.2 - Fixed : Child resized - parent follows. Parent resized - child does not scale.
		1.3 - FILL_AVAILABLE : Child scales to occupy the available space within parent. 
              Child cannot be resized. Parent resized - Child follows.
        1.4 - AUTO : Auto always depends on the child. So not applicable. (Have to handle it wrt Text )
		
		Case 2 - Parent is set to Fixed. Child set to :
		2.1 - Scale : Child resized - Parent does not scale. Parent resized - child follows.
		2.2 - Fixed : Child resied - Parent does not scale.  Parent resized - child does not scale. 
		2.3 - FILL_AVAILABLE : Child scales to occupy the available space within parent. 
              Child cannot be resized. Parent resized - child follows
        2.4 - AUTO : Auto always depends on the child. So not applicable. (Have to handle it wrt Text )

		Case 3 - Parent set to 	FILL_AVAILABLE. Parent encompasses all the children . CAN BE SET, IF THE PARENT HAS A PARENT WHICH IS NOT FILL_AVAILABLE/AUTO. Child set to : 
		3.1 - Scale : Child resized - Parent follows. Parent resized - child follows.
		3.2 - Fixed : Child resized - Parent follows. Parent resized - not possible as it has tto fit the parent. 
		3.3 - FILL_AVAILABLE : Child scales to occupy the available space within parent. 
              Child cannot be resized. Parent scales, child follows.
        3.4 - AUTO : Auto always depends on the child. So not applicable. (Have to handle it wrt Text )

        Case 4 - Parent is set to AUTO. Child set to :
        4.1 - Scale :   Child resized - parent is resized. Parent cannot be resized.
        4.2 - Fixed :   Child resized - parent is resized. Parent cannot be resized. 
        4.3 - FILL_AVAILABLE : NOT POSSIBLE - BOTH CANNOT BE SET
        4.4 - AUTO : This can be set only if the Child has a Child which is not AUTO.
